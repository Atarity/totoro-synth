# Totoro synth
Totoro is a portable, analog synth made on top of MCP6004 opamp. It features 2 VCOs (one could act as LFO) and simple VCF. Here it is [a short video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHeWAp9w_LM).

This open-source project based on [original design](https://syntherjack.net/totoro-1-ic-simple-synth/) of SyntherJack's Totoro and published with his permission.

In v1.0.1:
- Some of the components were rearranged
- Batteries moved on top side of PCB so overall assembly is almost 2 times thinner now
- Minor layout issues were fixed.
